    <h1 id="aboutheading">About Black & Owning It</h1>

    <p class="aboutpara">The idea behind Black & Owning It came about in 2019. My partner and I were visiting a pop up shop and while supporting the young black entrepreneurs we realized that so many people were missing out on incredible talent and products due to lack of promotion. We wanted to create one common space where you can find these small businesses and help support their endeavors with the click of a button. Thus, Black & Owning It was born.</p>

    <p class="aboutpara"> Black & Owning It, is a place where you can find and support black-owned businesses as well as networking, community and private events of the greater Philadelphia area. They also provide services to those who need help with brand advertisement, event promotion or connections to a vending advisor.</p>
